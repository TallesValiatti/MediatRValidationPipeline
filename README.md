# Implementing Validation Pipelines with MediatR and Fluent Validation in .NET

This repo is focused on implementing robust validation pipelines in a .NET web API using MediatR and Fluent Validation.

The implementation evolves from a traditional validation approach to a more structured and maintainable solution using MediatR for request handling and Fluent Validation for comprehensive input validation. By integrating these tools, the codebase demonstrates how to create a clean, modular validation process that enhances the reliability and maintainability of your API.

This setup ensures that your .NET applications can efficiently manage complex validation scenarios, leading to more resilient and scalable code.
